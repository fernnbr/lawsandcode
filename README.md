Welcome to Laws and Code, a repository that brings together fictional and real examples of legislation structured using Akoma Ntoso, LexML and XML formats, as part as my free subjects at 42. This repo is intended as an educational and exploratory resource for legal professionals, developers, students, and civic tech enthusiasts interested in machine-readable laws and open legal data.

**This repository includes (and will include)**

01) Fictional laws: Simple, invented laws used for demonstrations, learning, and experimentation
02) Real legal documents: Structured versions of actual legislative or regulatory texts encoded in Akoma Ntoso or LexML
3) 03) Multiple formats: Mainly Akoma Ntoso XML, but may also include other related standards such as LexML, LegalRuleML, or basic XML for structured data projects
  
[Hey, oooh. It feels so legal] **What's Akoman Ntoso?**

Akoma Ntoso [meaning linked hearts in Akan] is an open XML standard developed by the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs. It is used to model parliamentary, legislative, and judiciary documents in a structured and machine-readable way.

It's benefits includes (01) Transparency, (02) Structure, (03) Interoperability and (04) Automation 

**And LexML?**

LexML is a standard (and ecosystem of tools) designed to structure, identify, and access legal documents, such as laws, decrees, court rulings, and regulations, using XML and other web technologies.

It was created in Brazil, through a federal initiative involving the Senate, Chamber of Deputies, Supreme Court, and other institutions, to solve problems related to organization, searchability, and interoperability in legal texts, especially in large-scale government environments. Now it is now part of Brazil’s digital legal infrastructure, but its ideas can be adopted globally. 

**Why XML?**

XML is a flexible, plain-text format used to structure data hierarchically (like we use in HTML). It is widely used in government, law, publishing, and data exchange because it’s readable by both humans and machines, it supports validation via schemas (XSD), it’s interoperable and open and relatively easy to learn, it works well with stylesheets (XSLT), queries (XPath), and transformations to other formats (HTML, PDF), for example. 

**And why me, as a developer / tech person, should care or get interested on that?**

As a developer or tech professional, you should care about Akoma Ntoso and LexML because they unlock the power of structured legal data. Laws and regulations are essential but often locked in unstructured text, making them hard to search, analyze, or automate. When people work in public management, one of their key roles is to help make laws and regulations clear, accessible, and easy to manage. 

So, Akoma Ntoso and LexML are standards that organize legal documents into structured, machine-readable formats. This means that laws are not just plain text but well-organized data that computers can understand and process.

Using these standards helps governments publish laws and official documents in a consistent way. This consistency makes it easier for public officials, citizens, and businesses to find, read, and use the legal information they need. It also supports transparency by opening legal data to everyone, increasing trust in government.

For civic tech people or public managers, understanding these standards means you can support digital tools that automate tasks like searching for laws, tracking changes, or checking compliance. It also prepares you to work with modern legal technology projects that improve how governments operate and interact with citizens.

In short, Akoma Ntoso and LexML help transform traditional legal paperwork into smart, digital information. Tha means making public management more efficient, transparent, and citizen-friendly.

In today’s AI-driven world, having structured, high-quality data is more important than ever. Laws and legal documents contain complex information that AI systems can analyze, but only if that information is organized and machine-readable. Without standardized formats, AI struggles to understand the nuances of legal texts. So that, Akoma Ntoso and LexML enable AI models to parse, interpret, and reason about laws, making it possible to build tools for automated legal research, contract analysis, compliance monitoring, and even legal decision support.

As governments and organizations publish more legal data digitally, the demand for AI applications that can process and extract insights from this data grows. These standards ensure that AI has a reliable, consistent foundation to work on, improving accuracy and fairness in legal tech solutions.
